# About

This repository is home to useful and obscure code samples.

In regards to obscure, this means fringe case code that is seldom needed but when needed woohoo.

In some instances, code to use will be in one project, other times placed into class projects and when code is separated the markdown files will indicate this.

**Notes**

This line indicates that the namespace does not match it's location and should not even if not using `Resharper`.

```csharp
// ReSharper disable once CheckNamespace - do not change
```

**Windows forms**

Some examples are windows form specific while others simply can be understood better in a form rather than a console or test project.
