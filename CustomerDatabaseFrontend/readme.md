## Notes

1. The entire code sample can be done easier with EF Core but this code sample came from a forum question where the asker is not using EF.
2. Recommend using data annotation validation, for a starter see [the following repository](https://github.com/karenpayneoregon/ClassValidationVisualBasic)
